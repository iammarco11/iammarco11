<h3><ins>About</ins></h3>
Hi,

I am an open source enthusiast, lately trying to understand the basics of networks. I know the basics of web development too. I Occasionally contribute to Kirogi and the KDE community.

I am currently working on a basic [streaming platform](https://github.com/Team-SYNACKd/progressive-streaming)

How to reach me?<br>
